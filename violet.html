                            Known for its highly fragrant, purple-blue flowers that bloom in early spring.
                            The flowers are often used in perfumery and culinary applications.</li>
                            <li>Bird's Foot Violet (Viola pedata):
                            Native to North America, bird's foot violet features unique flowers with finely divided petals, resembling a bird's foot.

                    <div class="plant-care">
                        <h2>What to do and what not to do</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Planting Procedure:</strong></li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Spring or Fall: Plant violets in spring or fall when the weather is cool and the soil is moist. Avoid planting during extreme heat or cold.</li>

                                <li>Sunlight: Violets prefer partial shade to full shade, especially in regions with hot summers. They can tolerate some morning sun but prefer afternoon shade.</li>
                                <li>Soil: Violets thrive in well-drained, moist, and fertile soil with a slightly acidic to neutral pH. Incorporate organic matter such as compost or leaf mold to improve soil texture and fertility.</li>
